/**
 * Client-side coordination for self-initiated page removal operations.
 *
 * When a user removes a shared page from their view, the mutation fires POST /leave
 * which notifies the collab server via pg_notify. Moving an owned page to Trash
 * produces a similar terminal collaboration event.
 * The collab server then sends a revoke event over WebSocket, which MilkdownEditor
 * handles by showing a toast + navigating away.
 *
 * Without coordination, the user would see TWO toasts:
 *   1. Generic removal feedback from the collab revoke handler
 *   2. Item-specific feedback from the mutation onSuccess
 *
 * This module lets the entity deletion action signal that a leave or deletion
 * was self-initiated, so MilkdownEditor can skip its duplicate toast (the
 * mutation handles feedback).
 *
 * For admin-initiated revokes (admin removes your access while you're on the page),
 * no flag is set, so MilkdownEditor shows its toast as before.
